Set: A well-defined collection of objects.These objects are called the elements of the set

Disjoint sets: Two sets are said to be disjoint sets if they do not have any common elements.
Overlapping sets: If two Sets A and B have some common elements, then the sets are said to be overlapping sets.
A ? B = (A + B) – (A ? B)
A ? B ? C = A + B + C – A ? B – B ? C – C ? A + A ? B ? C
