Set: A well-defined collection of objects.These objects are called the elements of the set

Disjoint sets: Two sets are said to be disjoint sets if they do not have any common elements.
Overlapping sets: If two Sets A and B have some common elements, then the sets are said to be overlapping sets.
A U B = (A + B) – (A ^ B)
A U B U C = A + B + C – A ^ B – B ^ C – C ^ A + A ^ B ^ C
