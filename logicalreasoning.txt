The section tests a candidates ability to interpret data quickly and make decisions.Logical Reasoning questions could appear in the form of block questions, with each block carrying 2 to 4 questions, or as a single questions. Use diagramatic representation to solve them when necessary.

Circular arrangement is one of the question types under the logical reasoning section.Therefore we have to take into account multiple scenarios while attempting a circular arrangement question.

Blood relations are another category of frequently asked questions in the CAT. Diagramatic representation is the best way to solve them.

Tips to solve series problems.
    Try to identify one common factor in all the elements of the series. This could be a common increment (or a decrement), a common multiple or all the numbers could be perfect squares.
    In certain cases the series could take form of an Arithmatic Progression, a Geometric Progression or even a dual series.
    Try to identify numbers that appear often. See if there is any pattern to these numbers. What numbers appear often? Is there a pattern to these numbers?
    In case of fractions look for all the patterns in the numerator and the denominator

In Code Words, you are required to work out the code that has been used and to encode or decode a word.In practice, it is easier to have the word above the code and then to work down to encode or decode. 
Some examples of coding rules are:
Constant:
Increasing or decreasing:
Changing sign: 
Mixture of increasing/decreasing and changing sign:
Another form of Coded questions is the Mirror Image.
