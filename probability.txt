Probability = Favorable Cases/Total cases.
Deterministic Experiment: These are experiments which when repeated under identical conditions produce the same outcome.
Random Experiment: These are experiments which when conducted under identical conditions do not produce the same outcome.

When a random is repeated several times under identical conditions, then the experiment is called a trial and the possible outcomes of the experiment are the elementary events.
Example: Tossing of the coin is the trial and getting a heads or tails is an elementary event.

Events that are obtained by combining more than one elementary events are known as Compound events.
Example: If we consider the event of throwing of a dice, getting a multiple of 2 is the compound event because this occurs if any one of the elementary event 2, 4 and 6 occurs.
Exhaustive number of cases: The total number of possible outcomes of random experiment (in a trial) are known as exhaustive number of cases
Illustration: when we throw a dice the exhaustive number of cases is 6.

Mutually exclusive (or incompatible) events are those where the occurrences of any one of them prevents the occurrence of all the others
Equally likely cases: Events are said to be equally likely if there is no reason for an event to occur in preference to any other event.
Events are independent if the happening (or non-happening) of one event is not affected by the happening (or non-happening) of other

If there are ‘n’ – elementary events associated with a random experiment and ‘m’ of them are favorable to an event ‘A’ then probability of ‘A’ is denoted by P (A) and is defined as the ratio m/n.  0 < P (A) < 1
The number of cases in which the event ‘A’ will not happen is (n-m), therefore if A. denotes not happening of ‘A’, then the probability P ( A. ) of not happening of ‘A’ is given by P(A.) = (n-m)/n = 1 – m/n = 1 – P(A)
If P(A) = 1, ‘A’ is called certain event and if P( A. ) = 1, ‘A’ is called impossible event.

If ‘A’ and ‘B’ are two events associated with a random experiment, then P (A U B) = P (A) +P (B) – P (A ^ B)
If ‘A’ and ‘B’ are mutually exclusive events, then P (A ^ B) = 0, therefore P (A U B) = P(A) + P(B)
If ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’ are three events associated with a random experiment, then  P (A U B U C) = P (A) + P(B) + P(C) – P(A ^ B) – P(B ^ C) – P(A ^ C) + P(A ^ B ^ C)
If ‘A’ & ‘B’ are two events associated with a random experiment. Then 
P(A. ^ B) = P(B) – P(A ^ B)
P( A ^ B. ) = P(A) – P(A ^ B)

P (A/B) = Probability of Occurrence of ‘A’ under the condition that ‘B’ has already occurred.
If A & B are two events associated with a random experiment, then P(A ^ B) = P(A). P(B/A) if P(A) not 0 or P(A ^ B) = P(B).P(A/B) if P(B) not 0
