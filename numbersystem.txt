-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 are called integers
irrational number can be defined as an infinite non-recurring decimal number.
root of a number which cannot be exactly found is called a surd.
composite number can be defined as a number which has factors other than itself and 1.
sum up all the factors of a number (excluding the number itself) and the sum is equal to the number itself then this number is known as perfect number.
Two numbers are considered to be prime to each other when their HCF is 1, and they are called co-prime.
The number of ways in which a number Z can be written as the product of two factors, which are co-prime to each other, is 2power(Y)-1 where Y is the number of different prime factors of Z.
Check if a number is prime or not: Let`s look at the number 119. So let`s see if we have any prime numbers less than 11(sq. root of closest perfect square number which is ? 119) as a factor of 119. The prime numbers 2, 3, 5,7,11 are not the factors of 119 and hence 119 is a prime number.

Least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers can be defined as the smallest of the numbers, which is exactly divisible by each of them.
Highest common factor (HCF) of two or more numbers is the greatest number, which divides each of those numbers exact number of times.
Method: Express the two numbers as the product of prime numbers separately and take the product of numbers common to both numbers.
Product of two numbers = LCM?HCF.
LCM of fractions = LCM of numerators ? HCF of denominators
HCF of fractions = HCF of numerators ? LCM of denominators

A fraction whose numerator is greater than its denominator is known as an improper fraction. 
See the pattern that a number generates when it occurs in power of itself. All the numbers start repeating themselves after 4, the universal cyclicity of all numbers is 4.
578pow(1029): divide the exponent of the number by 4. So we divide 1029 by 4 and get the remainder as 1. unit`s digit of the number can be calculated by solving 8pow(1). Here 8 is the unit`s digit of the number 578 and 1 is the remainder.If the remainder is zero, then the unit digit will be same as the unit digit of Npow(4)
if a number `a x b` is divided by `n` the remainder is `ra x rb'(remainder when a is divided by n and when b is divided by n)(same applies to addition and subtraction)
Method to find square root of number
The Euler number of a number x means the number of natural numbers which are less than x and are co-prime to x.
[E(z)=z(1-\frac{1}{p})(1-\frac{1}{Q})(1-\frac{1}{R}).......\] Where P, Q and R are different prime factors of z
yE(z) divides z, the remainder will always be 1, where E(z) is Euler number of z and y and z are co-prime to each other.
