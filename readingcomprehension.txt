Tones that the author uses:
    Cynical: In this case the author might oppose or criticize something without any specific purpose and moreover without any positive suggestions.

In order to answer questions based on Reading Comprehension the following strategy should be applied.
    Select passages with familiar subject matters first and then answer them.
    Focus on the key sentences of the passages. Pay special attention to the first two lines of the passage, the first sentence of every paragraph and the last sentence of every paragraph. Glance through the rest
    Read the questions and not the options (answer choices). Answer all the questions that you want to answer without leaving anything for later (a lot of time could be wasted in re reading the passage)
