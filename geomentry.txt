Two angles are said to be complementary if the sum of two angles is equal to 90
Two angles formed with a common arm are adjacent angles
Two angles which have a common arm and the sum of angles is 180o, are called as linear pair 

Area of Triangle(Hero`s Formula) Area = [sqrt{s times (s-a) times (s-c) times (s-c)}]
where s is length semi-perimeter and a,b and c are length of sides of a triangle. 
The area of triangle is given by 1/2 ? base ? altitude 
The point of intersection of the angle bisectors of a triangle is called as incentre. 
Incentre is equidistant from all the three sides, incentre can drawn touching all the three sides.
The radius of this circle is called "in-circle" and is given by:
r = {Area of Triangle}/{Semi-perimeter}
Circumcentre: It is the point of intersection of perpendicular side bisectors of the triangle.
Circumradius = {Product of three sides}/{4 times {Area of Triangle}}
For Equilateral Triangle:
    Altitude = v3/2 ? side
    Area = v3/2 ? (side)2
    Inradius = 1/3 ? altitude
    Circumradius = 2/3 ? altitude
A line segment joining the vertex to the mid-point of the opposite side is called the median.The centroid divides the median in the ratio of 2:1.
A(x1, y1); B(x2, y2); C(x3, y3) are the coordinates of a triangle, then coordinates of centroid O are: [frac{x_{1}+ x_{2}+ x_{3}}{3},frac{y_{1}+ y_{2}+ y_{3}}{3}] 
The point at which all the altitudes meet is called the orthocentre.
If the sides and angles of one triangle are equal to the corresponding sides and angles of another triangle, then the two triangles are said to be congruent.
Two triangles are said to be similar if their angles are congruent but their sides are only proportional.

Angle Bisector Theorem: The internal bisector of an angle divides the opposite side in the ratio of lengths of its adjacent arms.  
Mid-point Theorem:The segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is always parallel to the third side and is half of third side.
Basic Proportionality Theorem:If the line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle and intersects other two sides at distinct points, then the other two sides are divided in the same ratio.
Appollonius Theorem: The sum of squares of any two sides of a triangle is equal to twice the sum of square of the median to the third side and the square of half of the third side.

A chord is a line segment that has its end points on the circle.
circumference is given by 2?r
The area of the circle is calculated using the formula ?*rPOW(2)
Major arc is greater than semi-circle and minor arc is smaller than semi-circle.
An angle in the plane of the circle with its vertex at the center is called central angle. 
Congruent Circles: Circles that have equal radii are known as congruent circles
Circles that lie in the same plane and have only one point in common are known as tangent circles.	
Length of direct common tangent = [sqrt{d^{2}-(r_{1}^{2}-r_{2}^{2})}]
Length of transverse common tangent = [sqrt{d^{2}-(r_{1}^{2}+r_{2}^{2})}]
Alternate Segment Theorem: Angle between any chord (at the point of tangency) and the tangent is equal to the angle subtended by the chord to any point on the other side of the tangent.
