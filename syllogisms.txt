It is a form of reasoning in which a conclusion is drawn from two given or assumed prepositions.

Universal Positive Statement indicates something positive to all the items of that category. These kinds of statements begin with all, every and each. It is represented by letter `A`
Universal Negative Statement indicates a negative meaning.These statements begin with No, None of the, Not a etc. It is represented by letter `E`
Though the Particular Positive Statement gives a positive impression but it only covers some items not all. They begin with some, any, a few etc. It is represented by letter `I`
Particular Negative Statement gives a negative impression about some items not all. It is represented by letter `O`

Rules:
    With two particular statements no universal conclusion is possible.
    With two positive statements no negative conclusion is possible.
    With two negative statements no positive conclusion is possible.
    With two particular statements no conclusion is possible, except when a `particular positive statement` type of statement is given and then by reversing it a `particular negative statement` type of conclusion is given.
