It is a form of reasoning in which a conclusion is drawn from two given or assumed prepositions.

Universal Positive Statement indicates something positive to all the items of that category. These kinds of statements begin with all, every and each. It is represented by letter `A`
Universal Negative Statement indicates a negative meaning.These statements begin with No, None of the, Not a etc. It is represented by letter `E`
Though the Particular Positive Statement gives a positive impression but it only covers some items not all. They begin with some, any, a few etc. It is represented by letter `I`

Rules:
    UP+UP=UP
    UP+UN=UN
    UN+ (UP/PP)=PN
    PP+ (UP/UN)=PP/PNs

You can use venn diagrams to solve them if time permits or use the ones below:
	All + All = All
	All + No = No
	All + Some = No Conclusion
	Some + All = Some
	Some + Some = No Conclusion
	Some + No = Some Not
	No + No = No Conclusion
	No + All = Some not reversed
	No + Some = Some not reversed
