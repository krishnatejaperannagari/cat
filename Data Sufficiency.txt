A typical Data Sufficiency problem shall present you with a question and a set of conditions. In order to tackle a Data sufficiency problem you must be able to conclude weather the given set of conditions is sufficient (or not) to answer the question.

The sufficiency condition for two statements in given in the following format:
    Statement (A) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (B) alone is not sufficient.
    Statement (B) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (A) alone is not sufficient.
    BOTH statements TOGETHER are sufficient, but NEITHER statement ALONE is sufficient.
    EACH statement ALONE is sufficient.
    Statement (A) and (B) TOGETHER are NOT sufficient.

While solving DATA SUFFICIENCY questions, follow following 3 rules:
    Examine the question
    Consider each statement individually
    Combine the two statements
