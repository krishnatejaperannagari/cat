You are expected to choose the most logical set of sentences that would construct the most coherent paragraph.

Locate the introductory sentence:We should immediately negate sentences beginning with transition words like also, again as well, but, So, Now, etc.
Locate the conclusive sentence:We need to choose a statement that summarizes and has links to all the previous sentences.
Logical links amongst pairs of sentences.
Anticipate the order of the sentences and confirm the closest option.
Plugging in: This tactic can be used when you are not sure of your option choices.

Transition words: These words make a logical shift from one idea to another.Observing the transition words found in a sentence can often give you a clue about the sentence that will come before/after that particular sentence.

Personal pronouns refer to a person, place or an object. If a sentence contains personal pronouns without mentioning the person, object or place, that means that the person, object or place must be mentioned in one of the sentences that might precede the sentence in the logical formation of the paragraph.
